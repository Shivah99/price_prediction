# Real Estate Price Prediction App

A machine learning web application that predicts real estate prices based on property features using Brain.js neural networks.

## Project Overview

This application is designed to predict real estate prices based on key property features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and property age. The prediction model uses a neural network implemented with Brain.js that has been trained on real estate data to provide accurate price estimations.

### Key Aspects
- **User-friendly input form** for property details
- **Neural network model** for accurate price predictions
- **Interactive data visualization** for understanding predictions
- **Persistent model storage** to retain training data
- **Responsive design** for cross-device compatibility

## Features in Detail

### 1. Neural Network Model
- The app uses a feedforward neural network implemented with Brain.js
- The model is trained on property features to predict prices
- Neural network configuration can be adjusted in the settings

### 2. Data Input & Validation
- Users can input property details through a form
- All inputs are validated to ensure data quality
- Error messages guide users to provide valid information

### 3. Prediction Functionality
- The model predicts property prices based on user input
- Results are displayed with confidence indicators
- Users can compare predictions with history

### 4. Data Visualization
- Charts display prediction history
- Feature importance is visualized to help users understand what factors affect price most
- Responsive charts adapt to different screen sizes

### 5. Model Storage
- Trained models are stored locally using IndexedDB
- Users can save and load different models
- Each prediction is stored to improve future predictions

### 6. Error Handling
- The app handles various error scenarios gracefully
- Fallback strategies ensure the app continues to function even when parts fail
- User-friendly error messages are displayed when needed

## Future Improvements

- Add more property features for more accurate predictions
- Implement more advanced neural network architectures
- Add user accounts for personalized model training
- Integrate with real estate APIs for data validation
- Add export/import functionality for models
